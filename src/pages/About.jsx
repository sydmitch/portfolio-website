      <p>
        I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in hospitality and administrative operations,
        now building clean and scalable web applications. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple,
        accessible user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into tech began with a curiosity about how websites work, which quickly turned into a passion
        for bringing ideas to life with code. After years of navigating fast-paced roles in hospitality and law,
        I realized I wanted to build systems that empowered people rather than overwhelmed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently earned a Software Engineering Certificate from University of Oklahoma, where I built a capstone
        project with full authentication, PostgreSQL schema design, Stripe integration, and React UI components.
        I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a mission-driven engineering team where I can continue to learn
        and contribute clean, meaningful code.

        I‚Äôm passionate about inclusive tech and creating space for people from marginalized communities to thrive ‚Äî
        especially queer and BIPOC individuals. Whether it's collaborating on team projects, attending meetups, or learning from
        others, I believe in tech as a tool for connection and social change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking, photography, bartending, and traveling. I‚Äôm especially fond of early 2000s digital cameras,
        curating playlists, and attending community-centered events. I value collaboration, lifelong learning, and
        inclusive spaces ‚Äî both online and in real life.
